# password-generator-using-python
The password generator project aims to create a simple tool that generates secure, random passwords. Users can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include special characters.
Key Features:
Customizable Length: Users can define the length of the generated password.
Special Characters Option: Users have the choice to include or exclude special characters (e.g., !, @, #) for increased complexity.
Randomness: The generator ensures randomness in the selection of characters to create unpredictable and secure passwords.
